        - description: '<emphasis role="bold">Example 1: This example changes the account alias for your &AWS; account to <code>mycompanyaws</code>. The address of the user logon page chages to https://mycompanyaws.signin.aws.amazon.com/console. The original URL using your account ID number instead of the alias (https://&lt;accountidnumber&gt;.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) continues to work. However, any previously defined alias-based URLs stop working.</emphasis>'
