            Note that virtual MFA device is not deleted from the account. The virtual device is still present and appears in the output of the <code>Get-IAMVirtualMFADevice</code> command. Before you can create a new virtual MFA device for the same user, you must delete the old one by using the <code>Remove-IAMVirtualMFADevice</code> command.</emphasis>
