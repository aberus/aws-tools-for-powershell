        excerpts:
        - description: '<emphasis role="bold">Example 1: This command applies two tags to a bucket named <code>cloudtrail-test-2018</code>: a tag with a key of Stage and a value of Test, and a tag with a key of Environment and a value of Alpha. To verify that the tags were added to the bucket, run <code>Get-S3BucketTagging -BucketName bucket_name</code>. The results should show the tags that you applied to the bucket in the first command. Note that <code>Write-S3BucketTagging</code> overwrites the entire existing tag set on a bucket. To add or delete individual tags, run the Resource Groups and Tagging API cmdlets, <code>Add-RGTResourceTag</code> and <code>Remove-RGTResourceTag</code>. Alternatively, use Tag Editor in the &AWS; Management Console to manage S3 bucket tags.</emphasis>'
